<x_0.333><y_0.5844><tbc>1 implies that, as the scale of human feedback data grows, so does the advantage afforded by efficient exploration. For the level of performance attained by 30,000 passive queries, double TS reduces data requirements by an order of magnitude. An alluring possibility is that, as the number of interactions grow to billions, efficient exploration may offer a multiplier effect reaching several orders of magnitude. This has the potential to accelerate by decades the attainment of superhuman creativity.
Section-header :  ## 5.3. Quality of Uncertainty Estimates
Text :  Boltzmann exploration performed best among algorithms we tried that select queries based on a point estimate reward model. The large improvement demonstrated by double TS is enabled by uncertainty estimates offered by our ENN reward model.
Text :  The quality of uncertainty estimates can be assessed in terms of dyadic joint negative-log loss<tbc>
