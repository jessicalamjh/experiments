 Efficient Exploration for LLMs<x_0.5361><y_0.3><class_Page-header>

<x_0.333><y_0.5922><tbc>1 implies that, as the scale of human feedback data grows, so does the advantage afforded by efficient exploration. For the level of performance attained by 30,000 passive queries, double TS reduces data requirements by an order of magnitude. An alluring possibility is that, as the number of interactions grow to billions, efficient exploration may offer a multiplier effect reaching several orders of magnitude. This has the potential to accelerate by decades the attainment of superhuman creativity.<x_0.666><y_0.6375><class_Text>

<x_0.332><y_0.4266>Figure 5 | Performance with passive, Boltzmann, infomax and double TS exploration algorithms. We can see that active exploration leads to much better levels of performance with the same amount of data. double TS exploration scheme leads to the best level of performance.<x_0.667><y_0.4484><class_Caption>
