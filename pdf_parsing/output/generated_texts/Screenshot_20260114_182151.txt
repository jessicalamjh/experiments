<x_0.3135><y_0.3016>detections (in 24/138 days from 15/29 birds, we did not set the threshold to the median value because of a software crash on the previous day). In 15 birds (six hearing and nine deaf, among which three received brain lesions), we delivered substitution on high-pitched syllable conditions, and in 15 birds (six hearing and nine deaf, among which three received brain lesions) we delivered substitution on low-pitched syllable conditions. Subs birds were dead birds exposed to LO substitution, unabsbirds birds were deaf and unsubstituted birds; LO birds were shearing and exposed to LO feedback, and noLO birds were bearing and not exposed to LO, subs-rand were deaf birds exposed to random LO events.<x_0.4941><y_0.3453><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.3531>Surgeries. Before the onset of surgery, we provided analgesia with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug carryprofer (2-4 mg/kg, Nowocarpa, ullamed AG, Sureae, Switzerland) given intra muscularity (FM). Birds were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane (1.5–3%) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. We applied the antiseptic peroxidase-isidine (Retadine, Mandipharma Medical Company, Basel, Switzerland) to the skin at the incision site, followed by the local anesthetic lidocaine in gel form (5%, EMLA, AstraZeneca AG, Zug, Switzerland).<x_0.4951><y_0.3867><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.3945>Deafening procedure. In the stereotaxic, the head angle formed by the flat part of the skull above the beak and the table was set to 90°. The skin was opened above the hyoid bone and the neck muscles were gently pushed back to expose the semi-circular canals. A hole was made in the skull to access the inner ear below the semi-circular canals. The cochlea was visually identified based on the surrounding bone structure and a small hole was made with forceps into the cochlear base. We removed the cockline from the cavity with a custom-made tungsten hook and took a picture of both intact cochleas including the lagras to document the success of the procedure (Fig. 1b).<x_0.4951><y_0.4336><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.4414>Area X lesions. We set the head angle formed by the flat part of the skull above the beak and the table to 35° and drilled a window into the skull above Area X. Area X was localised based on stereotactic coordinate and identified through the presence of tonsically firing neurons, recorded with a 0.6–1.7 MD tungsten electrode attached to a vertical manipulator. In each hemisphere we injected 1 μl of biotech acid (Tocts) near the center of Area X. Injection sites were located on average 1.5–19 mm medial lateral (ML), 5.5–6.0 mm anterior-posterior (AP), and 2.8–3.5 mm dorsal-ventral (DV) from the bifurcation of the midalagittal sinus (lambda). Injections were performed using a horosilicate glain pipette (R0–100–69–10, Satter instrument) pulled with a Prospritizer (Parker Inc.) and broken with forces to a tip diameter of about 10 μm.<x_0.4951><y_0.4906><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.4984>Histology. At the end of the experiment, birds were euthanized with an overdose of intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, Escomarkon, Streedi Pharma AG, Uznach, Switzerland) and intracardally perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) before brains were removed for histological examination. Brains rinsed in a 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution. The hemispheres were separated from each other, glued on a metal plate, and embedded in 3% agar. Sagittal slices of 80 μm thickness were cut with a Thermo Micron HM60VV microtome and mounted on slides for Niisal staining.<x_0.4951><y_0.5375><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.5453>Statistical pitch analysis. We curated the neural network detections manually by visually removing midstections (triggered by noises or similar vocal patterns not corresponding to the targeted syllable). We quantified the effects of LO on the pitch using d’ prime values d_<sub>ij</sub>_:<x_0.4951><y_0.5648><class_Text>

<x_0.3809><y_0.5672>\(d_{ij}=\frac{\mathaccent p{j}_i-\mathaccent p{j}_j}{\sqrt{\left(x_i^2+v_j^2\right)}},\)<x_0.4277><y_0.5836><class_Formula>

<x_0.3145><y_0.5859>where \(\mathaccent p{j}_i\) and \(\mathaccent p{j}_j\) are the mean pitches of the curated syllable on days i and j and \(\mathaccent p{j}\) and \(v_i^2\) and \(v_j^2\) are the respective pitch variances.<x_0.4941><y_0.5969><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.6016>LO start criterion. LO started after at least 5 days of stable singing \(\left(\left[d_{i-1,1}^*\right]_\text{C}<0.5\) with i being the last day of baseline); in two birds, LO started earlier find in one bird, LO started later because of technical issues and unforeseen scheduling constraints. In deal (subs) birds, LO started on average 16 days after deafening (range 9 days for bird 6 in Fig. 1g to 34 days for bird 3 in Fig. 1g) and in hearing (LO) birds it started after at least 7 days in isolation.<x_0.4951><y_0.6328><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.6344>In deaf birds, we did not find a significant correlation between the number of days between deafening and substitution onset and the absolute average pitch change per day (R = −0.21, P = 0.57) nor between the number of days since deafening and the maximum pitch change away from baseline during substitution (R = −0.09, P = 0.81).<x_0.4951><y_0.6586><class_Text>

<x_0.3145><y_0.6664>LO end criterion. We ended the LO paradigm (in both deaf and hearing birds) when the absolute mean pitch change (relative to baseline) either exceeded 2.5 d or when it statistical nuts area, which was defined as \(\left[d_{i-1,1}^*\right]_\text{C}<0.5\) with the index i referring to the last day of light off (in one bird), we ended substitution before this criterion was met because the song degraded too much for reliable syllable detection). The duration of the LO paradigm did not differ significantly between hearing and deafirds (p = 0.37, two-tailed two-sample tale test, mean hearing = 13 days, mean deaf = 111 days). Thus,<x_0.4951><y_0.7039><class_Text>

<x_0.5039><y_0.3023>the observed differences between hearing and deaf birds in Fig. 2c, f were not due to differences in time spent in the experimental chamber.<x_0.6846><y_0.3109><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.3125>The average daily pitch change d_<sub>ij</sub>_ during substitution in each animal (Figs. 1g and 2e) we quantified as \(\overline{d_{ij}^*}=\left(d_{i-1,1}^*\right)\rangle\), where the angle brackets denote averaging across all days i with LO (starting from the second day).<x_0.6846><y_0.3305><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.3312>Similarly, the average daily pitch change d_<sub>ij</sub>_ during the baseline period in each animal (light gray bars in Figs. 1g and 2e) we quantified as \(\overline{d_{ij}^*}=\left(d_{i-1,1}^*\right)\rangle\), where the average runs across the last 4 days i before LO.<x_0.6846><y_0.3492><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.3578>Magnitude pitch change. We assessed the magnitude pitch change in each bird irrespective of its preference (attraction or repulsion by LO). To discount for preference, we first defined the global direction δ of pitch change during LO as \(\delta=sign\left(d_{ij}^*\right)\), where k is the last day of baseline and l is the last day of LO exposure (k corresponds to the direction of the colored bars in Figs. 1g and 2e). Thus, if birds shifted pitch upward towards higher values, \(\delta=1\), and if birds shifted pitch down, \(\delta=-1\). In each animal, we computed the mean aligned pitch change T during substitution as the average daily change d_<sub>i-1,1</sub>_ multiplied with θ T = δ \(\left(d_{i-1,1}^*\right)\rangle\) (i = R_{min}\) email. Figure 2f shows T averaged over all birds. For control birds (unsubs, noLO), the direction of change δ was calculated analogously.<x_0.6846><y_0.4148><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.4242>Sound features other than pitch. To test whether substitution-induced changes of the targeted syllable were specific to pitch, we also inspected other sound features including syllable duration, amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and entropy. Syllable duration was defined as the interval between consecutive threshold crossings of the root mean-square (EME) sound waveform, where the threshold for each animal was kept constant for all days analyzed. AM, FM, FM, and entropy were computed as means over the entire syllable. We combined subs-low and subs-high birds by multiplying feature values in subs-low birds by -1 to account for the anti-symmetry between treatments. As a group, we compared the feature d’ values between the last LO day and the last day of the baseline (paired two-tailed t-test), Supplementary Fig. 1a.<x_0.6846><y_0.4773><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.4867>Pitch of non-targeted syllables. To test whether systematic pitch changes were restricted to the targeted syllable, we also inspected harmonic non-targeted syllables. In total, we found 10 such syllables in 5 birds. On these syllables as a group, we tested whether the pitch differences (d values) between the last day of substitution and the last day of baseline on average was different from zero. Again, we multiplied d’ values in subs-low birds by -1 to account for the anti-symmetry between treatments, Supplementary Fig. 1a. Pitch changes in non-targeted syllables across this time period were not different from zero average d’ = 0.01, P = 0.43, tat = 0.82, df = 9, two-tailed t-test, N = 10 syllables from 5 birds).<x_0.6846><y_0.5297><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.5391>Control (unsubs and noLO) birds. To evaluate whether an individual bird responded to substitution, we compared the daily pitch changes \(\left(d_{i-1,1}^*\right)_\text{D,10}\) of its targeted syllable to daily pitch changes in control birds (not exposed to LO). In subs birds, the control group was formed by 12 deafness (unsubs) birds, and in LO birds, the control group was formed by 12 beating (noLO) birds. To account for possible pitch drifts caused by deafening or by time spent in the experimental chamber, the time window for pitch analysis in unsubs birds was matched to the substitution period in the subs bird, i.e., the first day analyzed in control birds occurred at the same time leg after deafening as the first LO day. Also, the number of days analysed was identical in subsids and unsubirds (same for LO and noLO birds). To enforce robust statistics of pitch responses, we paired a subs-bird only to unsubirds that produced more than 1000 song months in each day during the matched time periods. Two unsubirds had to be excluded because they produced fewer than 100 readings of the available on days available on days 11 and 12 after deafening (resulting in a total of 10 unsubirds).<x_0.6846><y_0.6164><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.625>Statistical testing of pitch responses. To test whether an individual bird significantly changed its pitch in response to LO, we compared all its daily pitch changes during the LO period to all daily pitch changes in control birds in matched time windows (at significance level p = 0.05, without correction for multiple comparisons, two-tailed two-sample t-test, indicated by asterisks in Figs. 1g, z).<x_0.6846><y_0.6492><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.6508>For the population analysis, we compared daily pitch changes in all subs birds against all unsubirds controls (same for LO and noLO birds). We randomly paired the 10 unsubirds (dark gray bars in Fig. 1g) with the 10 unsubirds (under the constraint that analysis days could be temporally matched). The pairing is depicted in Fig. 1g such that bird 11 was paired with subs-test, i.e., bird 13 was paired with LO bird 2, etc. We did the same for the 12 LO birds in Fig. 2c, i.e., bird 13 was paired with LO bird 1, bird 14 was paired with LO bird 1, bird 14 was paired with LO bird 2, etc. All pairings were time-matched, i.e., the early baseline, light gray bars in Fig. 1g) and late time periods in controls were defined according to the baseline and LO periods in the treated bird.<x_0.6846><y_0.693><class_Text>

<x_0.5029><y_0.6945>To verify that we did not observe a spurious effect because of a single choice of random pairing, we randomly paired the birds 10000 times, always ensuring that<x_0.6836><y_0.7031><class_Text>
